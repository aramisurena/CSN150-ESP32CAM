## Steps I followed
1.Opened Arduino IDE and installed the ESP32 board support if needed.

Selected the correct board in Tools > Board.

Selected the correct COM port in Tools > Port.

Connected GPIO 0 to GND to enable flashing mode before uploading.

Checked that the power supply was set to 5V, since some ESP32-CAM boards need 5V to upload reliably..

Clicked Upload.

## Problems and Solutions
Failed to connect to ESP32 / Timed out waiting for packet header. Nothing appears in Serial Monitor.


**Solution:**

### Example Problem
**Problem:** Arduino code will not load on ESP32 Cam.
**Solution:** Camera drivers were incorrect I needed to install the driver: [https://www.wch-ic.com/downloads/CH341SER_ZIP.html](https://github.com/martin-ger/esp32_nat_router).  I used file, "CH341SER.ZIP" and it worked.
